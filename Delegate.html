                        forefront before disaster struck July 
                        4th, 2001.  What was supposed to be 
                        a day of celebrating American 
                        Independence turned into a day of 
                        reckoning.  Casey found out that his 
                        grand father was in fact Canadian, and 
                        to make matters worse, French 
                        Canadian.  The inner conflict between 
                        heritage and honor has raged on 
                        every year since...<br/><br/>

                        secrecy.    But he might tell you if you

                        takes him to all reaches of the globe.  
                        He claims that his suave sales and 
                        negotiating skills are the secrets to his 
                        success.  But everyone that knows him 
                        will argue that his success lies in the 
                        Season Salt.  Rob can also be credited 
                        with slick driving skills and his true 
                        dedication as a wingman.<br/><br/>

                        He prided himself on trips to  the Home

                        Beyond if theres time.  We look to him 
                        for support in our darkest times.  He 
                        always has a shoulder to cry on and 
                        was a great listener.  As Willy's God 
                        Father, he has his work cut out for him 
                        which ultimately results in trouble.<br/><br/>

                        competitive dancer.  He takes pride in 
                        dedicating his training to many ancient 
                        dance styles.  His most recent 
                        competition left him with the silver 
                        medal.  The gold went to the Dancing 
                        Baby.  Failures aside, it always helps

                        Arnold.  He defected to the United 
                        States in 1995 to seek higher 
                        education.  In an attempt to save 
                        face with his countryman, he 
                        returned to the Great White North 
                        after college only to move back 
                        again to the U.S.  His latest attempt 
                        was to marry a U.S. Citizen to 
                        hopefully gain acceptance into the 
                        U.S.  His action caused major 
                        backlash in Canada and they have 
                        revoked his Team Canada status.  
                        He had no choice but to accept 
                        Mexico as his Country.<br/><br/>
